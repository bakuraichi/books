# Effective Engineer Summary
## by: Devin Ryan Riota


##Effective Engineer
* They’re the people who get things done. They’re the ones who ship products that users love, launch features that customers pay for, build tools that boost team productivity, and deploy systems that help companies scale. Effective engineers produce results.
* Effective engineers, therefore, also get things done efficiently.
* Effective engineers focus on value and impact—they know how to choose which results to deliver. An effective engineer, therefore, is defined by the rate at which he or she produces value per unit of time worked.

##Adopt The Right Mindsets
###Focus on High Leverage Activities
Leverage = value or impact / time invested
